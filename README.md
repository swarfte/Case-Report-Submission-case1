## Developing Products on Internet Time

The rise of the World Wide Web has provided one of the most challenging environments for product development in recent history. The market needs that a product is meant to satisfy and the technologies required to satisfy them can change radically—even as the product is under development. In response to such factors, companies have had to modify the traditional product-development process in which design implementation begins only once a product’s concept has been determined in its entirety. Instead, they have pioneered a flexible product-development process that allows designers to continue to define and shape products even after implementation has begun. This innovation enables Internet companies to incorporate rapidly changing customer requirements and evolving technologies into their designs until the last possible moment before a product is introduced to the market.

> 在快速變化的市場環境中，靈活的產品開發過程的重要性。作者提到了互聯網公司如何在產品開發過程中不斷地根據客戶需求和技術演變進行調整，以滿足市場需求。此外，作者還提到了其他行業，如計算機工作站和銀行等，也面臨著技術快速變化、客戶需求變化和監管變化的挑戰，因此需要採用更靈活的產品開發方法。

<br>

Flexible product development has been most fully realized in the Internet environment because of the turbulence found there, but the foundations for it exist in a wide range of industries where the need for responsiveness is paramount. Product developers in industries from computer workstations to banking increasingly face dynamic and unpredictable environments characterized by rapidly evolving technologies, changing customer tastes, and sweeping regulatory changes. In these industries, companies that have begun to adopt more flexible product-development approaches are setting new competitive standards.

> 在動盪的商業環境中，產品開發的順序過程不僅效率低下，還可能導致產品過時，無法滿足客戶需求並利用最新技術。當新競爭對手和技術可能一夜之間出現，標準和法規不斷變化，以及公司的整個客戶群可以輕易轉向其他供應商時，企業不需要一個抵制變革的開發過程，而需要一個擁抱變革的過程。

<br>

What’s involved in increasing the flexibility of the product development process? Many of the companies we studied have adopted a coherent set of mechanisms that allow product developers to generate and respond to new information about what customers want and about how technology has evolved over the course of a project. These mechanisms not only enable a continuous flow of information about customer needs and new technologies but also reduce both the cost and the time it takes to integrate that information into the evolving product design. They allow designers continually to sense customer needs, to test alternative technical solutions, and to integrate the acquired knowledge into a coherent product design. This flexible process continues iteratively throughout the development process.

> 解釋了提高產品開發過程靈活性的重要性。採用一套一致的機制來生成和回應有關客戶需求和技術演變的新信息的公司可以創建靈活的產品開發過程。這種方法使客戶需求和新技術的信息持續流動，降低了將這些信息整合到不斷演變的產品設計中的成本和時間。因此，設計師可以在整個開發過程中不斷感知客戶需求，測試替代技術方案，並將所獲得的知識整合到一個連貫的產品設計中。

<br>

The traditional development processes that many companies use are highly structured. A future product is designed, developed, transferred to production, and rolled out to the market in clearly articulated, sequential phases. Such processes usually begin with the identification of users’ needs and an assessment of the various technological possibilities. Then a detailed set of product specifications is created and, once approved by senior management, is set in stone. At that point, attention shifts to implementation as a functionally integrated team translates the concept into reality. If the up-front work has been done correctly, inherently expensive changes to the product’s specifications are kept to a minimum. Indeed, the number of engineering changes is often used as a measure of a project’s effectiveness: many changes signify an inferior effort.

> 在傳統的產品開發過程中，許多公司使用高度結構化的方法。未來產品的設計、開發、生產轉移和市場推廣都在清晰的順序階段中進行。這些過程通常從確定用戶需求和評估各種技術可能性開始。然後創建一個詳細的產品規格集，一旦經過高層管理的批准，就會確定下來。此時，注意力轉向實施，功能集成的團隊將概念轉化為現實。如果前期工作做得正確，對產品規格的固有昂貴變更將保持在最低限度。事實上，工程變更的次數通常被用作衡量項目效果的指標：變更次數多表示努力不足。

<br>

In contrast, flexible product development delays until as late as possible any commitment to a final design configuration. The concept development phase and the implementation phase thus overlap instead of following each other sequentially. By accepting the need for and reducing the cost of changes, companies are able to respond to new information that arises during the course of a product’s development. Systemic changes in a project’s definition and basic direction are managed proactively; designers begin this process with no precise idea of how it will end. (See the chart “Two Approaches to Product Development.”)

> 與傳統產品開發相比，靈活產品開發將對最終設計配置的承諾延遲到最晚。因此，概念開發階段和實施階段彼此重疊，而不是按順序進行。通過接受變更的需求並降低變更成本，公司能夠在產品開發過程中應對新信息。專案定義和基本方向的系統性變更被積極管理；設計師在開始這個過程時對結果並無明確的想法。

## Two Approaches to Product Development

Speed is a subtle concept in this model. Total lead time—the time taken to fulfill the initial objectives of the project—is ...

Today a rigid, sequential development approach can risk creating an obsolete product.

When technology, product features, and competitive conditions are predictable or evolve slowly, a traditional development process works well. But in turbulent business environments, a sequential approach to product development is more than inefficient; it risks creating an obsolete product—one that fails to address customer needs and to make use of the latest technologies. When new competitors and technologies are likely to appear overnight, when standards and regulations are in flux, and when a company’s entire customer base can easily switch to other suppliers, businesses don’t need a development process that resists change—they need one that embraces it.

## A Flexible Process at Work

Not every company interested in developing a flexible product-development process would have to go to the extremes that Netscape did. But by looking at Netscape’s experiences, we can see how a highly flexible process works. Founded in 1994, the company pioneered the easy-to-use Web browser: a software interface that provides access to the World Wide Web. The Web browser has transformed the Internet from a communications channel for scientists and technicians into a network connecting millions of ordinary users across time and space—and thus into an industry in its own right.

> 講述了 Netscape 如何通過靈活的產品開發過程來應對快速變化的市場需求和競爭。Netscape 在開發其網頁瀏覽器 Navigator 時，面臨著技術複雜性和不確定性的挑戰。通過多次發布 Beta 版本並從用戶那裡獲取反饋，Netscape 能夠在產品開發過程中不斷調整和改進。與此同時，微軟作為競爭對手，也在開發自己的網頁瀏覽器 Internet Explorer，並在短時間內迎頭趕上。微軟的產品開發過程同樣靈活，主要依賴於內部測試和有限的外部 Beta 版本發布。

<br>

But Netscape faced no easy task in developing its Web browser, Navigator. In the rapidly evolving Internet industry, many alternative technologies and applications compete for attention, and product development is a project manager’s nightmare. The major challenge in the development of a Web browser is the level of technical complexity involved: a typical program rivals a traditional word processing or spreadsheet application in size, and it must work seamlessly with myriad different hardware and software platforms. The level of uncertainty is so high that even the most basic decisions about a product must be continually revised as new information arises. And the fact that industry giant Microsoft, which had already developed its own flexible product-development process, was readying a product to compete with Navigator only added to the complexity and urgency of Netscape’s development effort.

> 在快速發展的互聯網行業中，Netscape 面臨著開發其網頁瀏覽器 Navigator 的艱鉅任務。許多替代技術和應用程序在該行業中爭奪關注，產品開發成為項目經理的噩夢。開發網頁瀏覽器的主要挑戰在於涉及的技術複雜性：典型的程序在大小上與傳統的文字處理或電子表格應用程序相當，並且必須與眾多不同的硬件和軟件平台無縫協作。不確定性如此之高，以至於即使是關於產品的最基本決策也必須在新信息出現時不斷修訂。而且，行業巨頭微軟已經開發了自己的靈活產品開發流程，並準備推出與 Navigator 競爭的產品，這只會增加 Netscape 開發工作的複雜性和緊迫性。

<br>

Netscape introduced Navigator 2.0 to the market in January of 1996 and immediately thereafter began to develop the next version of the Web browser, Navigator 3.0, which was to be released in August of the same year. The Netscape development group—which included staff from engineering, marketing, and customer support—produced the first prototype quickly. By February 14, just six weeks into the project, it had put a Beta 0 version of the program up on the company’s internal project Web site for testing by the development staff. Although many of the intended functions were not yet available, the prototype captured enough of the essence of the new product to generate meaningful feedback from members of the development group. On February 22, less than two weeks later, the team posed an updated version, Beta 1, again for internal development staff only. In early March, with major bugs in the product worked out, the first public release, Beta 2, appeared on Netscape’s Internet Web site. Additional public releases followed thereafter every few weeks until the official release date in August, with gradual refinements appearing in each beta iteration.

> 描述了 Netscape 如何在開發 Navigator 3.0 的過程中使用靈活的產品開發方法。他們迅速製作了第一個原型，並在短短六周內完成了 Beta 0 版本。隨後，團隊不斷更新 Beta 版本，並在每個迭代中進行改進。這使得開發團隊能夠根據用戶反饋和市場變化進行調整，從而更好地滿足客戶需求。

<br>

## The Development of Navigator 3.0: A Timeline

![image](https://github.com/swarfte/Case-Report-Submission-case1/blob/main/The%20Development%20of%20Navigator%203.0%20A%20Timeline.gif)

The sequence of beta versions was extremely useful to Netscape because it enabled the development team to react both to feedback from users and to changes in the marketplace while the team was still working on the Web browser’s design. Beta users by and large are more sophisticated than Netscape’s broader customer base and therefore are a valuable source of information. Most useful among them are developers from other Internet software companies, who tend to be extremely vocal customers. Because many of these customers use the Navigator browser as part of the environment in which their own products operate, they are often the first to find the more complicated bugs—bugs that are revealed only when the product is stretched to the limits of its performance in complex applications.

> 描述了 Netscape 如何在開發 Navigator 3.0 的過程中利用多個 Beta 版本來收集用戶反饋和應對市場變化。這使得開發團隊能夠在產品開發過程中不斷調整和改進，從而更好地滿足客戶需求。

<br>

Getting input from users was one way in which the Navigator team generated new information during the course of the project. During the seven-month development cycle, however, the team also paid careful attention to competing products. As the largest and most powerful software developer in the industry, Microsoft was considered a very serious threat to Netscape’s then-dominant position in the browser market. The software giant had just undertaken a dramatic—and very public—switch in strategy, refocusing its formidable talents squarely on the Internet. As a result, Netscape continually monitored the latest beta versions of Microsoft’s competing product, Explorer, to compare features and formats. Based on the information that it gathered, the Netscape team would often add format or feature changes to the current beta version of its own product.

> 這段文字描述了 Navigator 團隊在開發過程中如何通過獲取用戶反饋和關注競爭產品來生成新信息。在七個月的開發周期中，團隊密切關注了微軟等競爭對手的產品。作為行業最大、最強大的軟件開發商，微軟被認為是對 Netscape 當時在瀏覽器市場的主導地位的嚴重威脅。因此，Netscape 不斷監控微軟競爭產品 Explorer 的最新 Beta 版本，以比較功能和格式。根據收集到的信息，Netscape 團隊經常將格式或功能更改添加到自己產品的當前 Beta 版本中。

<br>

In order to respond to the constant stream of new information being brought into the development process, the team carried out extensive experimentation and testing. Subgroups working on individual features went through numerous design-build-test cycles, gradually adding functionality to the product. As features were completed, the team integrated them into the evolving product, then conducted tests to ensure that the new feature did not produce unwanted interactions with other parts of the system. These so-called system builds occurred with increasing frequency as the project progressed; they were performed at least daily in the run-up to the official release.

> 在開發過程中，為了應對不斷湧入的新信息，團隊進行了大量的實驗和測試。專門負責單個功能的小組經歷了多次設計-構建-測試循環，逐步為產品增加功能。隨著功能的完成，團隊將其整合到不斷演變的產品中，然後進行測試以確保新功能不會與系統的其他部分產生不必要的交互作用。隨著項目的進展，這些所謂的系統構建的頻率越來越高；在正式發布之前的過程中，至少每天進行一次。

<br>

To facilitate the integration of the vast amounts of information generated during the project, Netscape set up a project Web site on its intranet. The site contained the product’s development schedule and specifications, each of which was updated as target dates changed or new features were added. In addition, it contained bulletin boards through which team members could monitor the evolution of various parts of the design, noting the completion of specific features and logging problems in the existing version. Once the Navigator moved to public beta testing, these intranet features became especially valuable because an increasing amount of information then had to be received, classified, and processed.

> 描述了 Netscape 如何在其內部網絡上設立一個專案網站，以便整合在專案過程中產生的大量信息。該網站包含產品的開發進度和規格，隨著目標日期的變更或新功能的添加而不斷更新。此外，它還包含公告板，團隊成員可以通過公告板監控設計各部分的演變，記錄特定功能的完成情況並記錄現有版本中的問題。當 Navigator 進行公開 Beta 測試時，這些內部網絡功能變得尤為重要，因為此時需要接收、分類和處理越來越多的信息。

<br>

Netscape built into its product-development process considerable flexibility to respond to changes in market demands and technology. And what is already true of companies in the Internet industry is becoming true of companies elsewhere. Our research on the computer-workstation-and-server industry has shown that there, too, a more flexible process is associated with greater performance. In this environment, companies with a faster response time, as measured from the construction of the first physical prototype to commercial shipping, clearly outperform those with slower response times. The use of sophisticated simulation tools allows teams to work with a virtual prototype for much of the project—in effect, creating a significant overlap between the concept and the design implementation phases.

> 描述了 Netscape 如何在其產品開發過程中加入了很大的靈活性，以應對市場需求和技術的變化。在互聯網行業中，這種靈活性已經變得越來越重要。研究顯示，在計算機工作站和服務器行業，靈活的開發過程與更高的性能相關。在這種環境下，反應時間更快的公司（從構建第一個實物原型到商業運輸）明顯優於反應時間較慢的公司。使用先進的模擬工具可以讓團隊在項目的大部分過程中使用虛擬原型，實際上在概念和設計實施階段之間創建了顯著的重疊。

<br>

According to Allen Ward and his colleagues in “The Second Toyota Paradox: How Delaying Decisions Can Make Better Cars Faster” (Sloan Management Review, Spring 1995), there also is evidence that a more flexible model has emerged in the automotive industry. Toyota’s development process allows it to delay many design decisions until later in the development cycle. The development team creates several sets of design options and, finally, through a process of elimination, selects only one for implementation. As a result, Toyota can respond to changing market conditions at a later stage than many of its competitors.

> 根據 Allen Ward 及其同事在《第二個豐田悖論：如何通過延遲決策製造更好的汽車更快》（Sloan Management Review，1995 年春季）中的研究，汽車行業也出現了更靈活的模型。豐田的開發過程允許在開發周期的後期延遲許多設計決策。開發團隊創建了幾套設計選項，最後通過消除過程，僅選擇一個用於實施。因此，豐田可以在比許多競爭對手更晚的階段應對市場變化。

<br>

## The Foundations of a Flexible Process

How should companies create a flexible development process? The experiences of leading companies suggest that senior managers first must understand what gives the process its flexibility. Product development flexibility is rooted in the ability to manage jointly the evolution of a product and its application context. The goal is to capture a rich understanding of customer needs and alternative technical solutions as a project progresses, then to integrate that knowledge into the evolving product design. The faster a project can integrate that information, the faster that project can respond to changes in the product’s environment.

> 闡述了如何建立靈活的產品開發流程。首先，高級管理者需要了解使流程具有靈活性的因素。產品開發的靈活性源於共同管理產品及其應用場景的演變能力。目標是在項目進行過程中獲得對客戶需求和技術解決方案的豐富理解，然後將這些知識整合到不斷演變的產品設計中。項目能夠更快地整合這些信息，就能更快地應對產品環境的變化。

<br>

The value of flexible product development, however, is only as good as the quality of the process it uses to generate information about the interaction between technical choices and market requirements. Unlike traditional development projects, which rely on periodic bursts of input on users’ needs, projects in turbulent business environments require continual feedback. To acquire and use this information, the development process must be able to sense customer needs, to test alternative technical solutions, and to integrate the knowledge gained of both markets and technologies into a coherent product. (See the chart “The Structure of a Flexible Product-Development Process.”)

> 強調了靈活產品開發的價值取決於其用於生成技術選擇與市場需求之間互動信息的過程質量。與傳統開發項目依賴於周期性用戶需求輸入不同，動盪商業環境中的項目需要持續反饋。為了獲得並使用這些信息，開發過程必須能夠感知客戶需求，測試替代技術方案，並將市場和技術方面獲得的知識整合成一個連貫的產品。

## The Structure of a Flexible Product-Development Process

![image](https://github.com/swarfte/Case-Report-Submission-case1/blob/main/The%20Structure%20of%20a%20Flexible%20Product-Development%20Process.gif)

As we describe how leading companies have achieved a more flexible development process, many of the examples we cite come from our work with several software companies that have recently launched Internet products or services. But bear in mind that this is not the only industry in which these lessons apply. We also describe specific practices from other, more traditional industries to illustrate that the approaches used are not unique to the Internet. In fact, they represent cutting-edge practice across a range of environments where change is—or is becoming—the norm.

> 描述了在靈活產品開發過程中，作者引用了許多來自與互聯網產品或服務相關的軟件公司的實例。然而，這並不是唯一適用這些經驗教訓的行業。作者還舉了來自其他更傳統行業的具體做法，以說明這些方法並非僅限於互聯網行業。實際上，它們代表了在各種變化是或正在成為常態的環境中的尖端實踐。

<br>

## Sensing the Market.

The first element of a flexible process is sensing the needs of customers and the market. Flexible projects establish mechanisms for getting continual feedback from the market on how the evolving design meets customers’ requirements. They do so by creating intensive links with the customer base—links that range from broad experimentation with many customers to selective experiences with a few lead users. Furthermore, these customers do not have to be external to the company: leading companies make extensive use of internal staff and resources to provide a test bed for evolving new products.

> 靈活開發過程的第一個要素是感知客戶和市場的需求。靈活的項目建立了從市場獲得持續反饋的機制，以了解不斷演變的設計如何滿足客戶需求。他們通過與客戶群建立密切聯繫來實現這一目標，這些聯繫可以從與眾多客戶進行廣泛的實驗到與少數領先用戶進行精選體驗。此外，這些客戶不一定要來自公司外部：領先公司大量利用內部員工和資源，為不斷演變的新產品提供測試平台。

<br>

Gaining continual feedback from customers was particularly critical at Netscape because of its dramatic head-to-head race with Microsoft. Netscape’s broad-based release of multiple beta versions to its entire customer base allowed users to play a significant role in the evolving product design. At the same time, it allowed Netscape to test an extremely complex technical product. Although not all Netscape’s customers actually experimented with beta versions, the Web browser’s most advanced users had to because they themselves were creating products that needed to work seamlessly with the Navigator release. And their feedback clearly had an impact: a significant portion of the new code, features, and technology that were integrated into the new release was developed only after the first beta version went public.

> 描述了在 Netscape 與 Microsoft 激烈競爭的情況下，不斷從客戶那裡獲得反饋對 Netscape 至關重要。Netscape 將多個 Beta 版本廣泛發布給所有客戶，讓用戶在產品設計的演變中發揮重要作用。同時，這也讓 Netscape 能夠測試一個極其複雜的技術產品。雖然並非所有 Netscape 的客戶都實際嘗試了 Beta 版本，但最先進的用戶必須這樣做，因為他們自己正在創建需要與 Navigator 發布版本無縫協作的產品。他們的反饋顯然產生了影響：在第一個 Beta 版本公開後，才開發了大部分新的代碼、功能和技術，並將其整合到新版本中。

<br>

Microsoft, Netscape’s chief rival, was slow to recognize the opportunities offered by the World Wide Web. Not until the end of 1995 did the company begin to focus on developing Internet products. Yet when Bill Gates and the rest of the senior management team finally acknowledged the need for a strategic shift, Microsoft’s development expertise was unleashed with astonishing speed. In the six months from the end of 1995 to the middle of 1996, the company went from having no presence in the critical browser market to offering a product that several industry experts claimed was comparable to or better than Netscape’s Navigator.

> 描述了微軟在最初未能快速認識到世界網絡的機會，直到 1995 年底才開始專注於開發互聯網產品。然而，當比爾·蓋茨和其他高層管理團隊最終承認需要進行戰略轉變時，微軟的開發專業知識以驚人的速度得到了釋放。從 1995 年底到 1996 年中，該公司在關鍵的瀏覽器市場上從無到有，提供了一款幾位行業專家聲稱與 Netscape 的 Navigator 相當或更好的產品。

<br>

Microsoft was able to react quickly because its existing product-development process had been founded on the rapid iteration of prototypes, early beta releases, and a flexible approach to product architecture and specification. (For a detailed account of Microsoft’s development process, see Michael A. Cusumano and Richard W. Selby, Microsoft Secrets [Free Press, 1995].) The process that Microsoft followed in developing its Internet Explorer was similar to Netscape’s but was more internally oriented. With more than 18,000 employees to Netscape’s 1,000 at the time, Microsoft could test successive Explorer beta versions extensively just by putting them up on its own intranet. “Everyone around Microsoft is encouraged to play with it,” explained a Microsoft program manager. “Internal testing means that we release it to thousands of people who really hammer away at it. We use the product much more heavily than the average Web user.” Microsoft combined broad internal testing by employees with carefully staged external beta releases, using only two or three in contrast to Netscape’s six or seven. The company thus limited the risk that imperfections in early releases might damage its reputation.

> 這段文字描述了微軟能夠迅速反應的原因，因為其現有的產品開發流程基於快速迭代原型、早期 Beta 版本以及靈活的產品架構和規格。微軟在開發 Internet Explorer 時所遵循的流程與 Netscape 類似，但更注重內部。當時微軟擁有超過 18,000 名員工，而 Netscape 僅有 1,000 名，微軟僅通過將其放在自己的內部網絡上就可以對連續的 Explorer Beta 版本進行廣泛測試。一位微軟程序經理解釋說：“鼓勵微軟周圍的每個人都去嘗試使用它。內部測試意味著我們將其發布給數千人，他們會對其進行大量測試。我們使用該產品的程度遠超一般網絡用戶。”微軟將員工的廣泛內部測試與精心策劃的外部 Beta 版本發布相結合，僅使用兩到三個，而不是像 Netscape 那樣使用六到七個。因此，這家公司降低了早期版本中的不完善可能損害其聲譽的風險。

<br>

A similar flexible philosophy can be used in the development of services. Consider Yahoo!. Founded in 1995, the company offers search, directory, and programming services for navigating the World Wide Web. As a service provider, the company believes that before a new offering is released to the outside world, it needs to be more robust than the typical Internet software beta. The market risk of broad, public testing is too high: users who try a new service once and have an unsatisfactory experience with it either are unlikely to return or, worse, may defect to competitors. Furthermore, Yahoo! assumes that competing companies will copy the innovative features of a new service once it has been released. These factors suggest delaying external testing to late in the development cycle.

> 這段文字提到了靈活開發理念在服務開發中的應用。以 Yahoo! 為例，該公司成立於 1995 年，提供搜索、目錄和編程服務，以便在世界網絡中導航。作為一家服務提供商，該公司認為在新服務向外界發布之前，它需要比典型的互聯網軟件 Beta 版本更為穩定。廣泛的公共測試市場風險過高：用戶如果對新服務的體驗不滿意，可能不再使用，甚至可能轉向競爭對手。此外，Yahoo! 假設競爭公司在新服務發布後會復制其創新功能。這些因素表明應該在開發周期的後期進行外部測試。

<br>

For these reasons, Yahoo! puts early versions of new services on-line for internal use only. Given its development team’s technical skills and breadth of experience, these trials expose any major technical flaws in the service and provide additional suggestions for improving functionality. Only then does Yahoo! begin a “soft release” of the offering: the service is put up on Yahoo!’s Web site but without any links to highly frequented parts of the site. As a result, only the more technically aggressive users are likely to find and use the service at this stage. Yahoo! also asks some of the 30,000 users, who have volunteered to be beta testers, to try the new service—thus exposing the service to rigorous external testing without revealing it to unsophisticated users who might be frustrated by a slow, incomplete, or error-ridden version.

> 由於上述原因，Yahoo! 將新服務的早期版本僅供內部使用。鑒於開發團隊的技術能力和豐富經驗，這些試驗可以揭示服務中的任何主要技術缺陷，並提供改進功能的其他建議。然後，Yahoo! 才開始對這項服務進行“軟發布”：將服務放在 Yahoo! 的網站上，但不與網站上經常訪問的部分建立任何連接。因此，只有技術上較為進取的用戶可能在這個階段找到並使用該服務。Yahoo! 還要求其中一些自願成為 Beta 測試人員的 30,000 名用戶嘗試新服務，從而使服務接受嚴格的外部測試，而不會將其暴露給可能因速度慢、不完整或錯誤的版本而感到沮喪的不成熟用戶。

<br>

The Netscape, Yahoo!, and Microsoft examples illustrate several approaches to sensing customer and market needs: broad consumer testing, broad internal testing, and testing by lead users. Companies adopting a flexible development approach should consider the merits of each, as well as the potential for using a balanced combination of all. It is important to emphasize, however, that these techniques are not unique to the Internet. Advances in information technology now allow companies to sense customer needs in ways not possible a few years ago. Leading companies in many industries have begun to use these new capabilities.

> 以 Netscape、Yahoo! 和 Microsoft 為例，說明了感知客戶和市場需求的幾種方法：廣泛的消費者測試、廣泛的內部測試和領先用戶的測試。採用靈活開發方法的公司應該考慮每種方法的優點，以及使用所有方法的平衡組合的可能性。然而，需要強調的是，這些技術並非僅限於互聯網。信息技術的進步現在使公司能夠以幾年前無法實現的方式感知客戶需求。許多行業的領先公司已經開始使用這些新功能。

<br>

Fiat, for example, used a broad, external testing approach, not unlike Netscape’s, to evaluate several automobile concepts. A link on the company’s Web site directed customers to a page aimed at evaluating users’ needs for the next generation of the Fiat Punto, its highest-volume car, which sells about 600,000 units per year. Customers were asked to fill out a survey indicating their preferences in automobile design. They could prioritize the following five considerations: style, comfort, performance, price, and safety. Then they were asked to describe what they hated most in a car and to suggest ideas for new features. Next the software allowed customers to design a car themselves. They could select from a variety of body styles, wheel designs, and styles for the front and rear of the automobile. They also could examine different types of headlights, details, and features. In this way, users could experiment with different designs and see the results immediately on the screen. The software captured the final results; in addition, it traced the sequence that customers went through in evaluating and selecting options. This information told designers much about the logic customers used to evaluate features, styles, and characteristics in order to arrive at a given design solution.

> 以 Fiat 為例，描述了該公司使用類似於 Netscape 的廣泛外部測試方法來評估幾種汽車概念。該公司的網站上有一個鏈接，將客戶引導到一個旨在評估用戶對下一代 Fiat Punto（其最高銷量車型，每年售出約 60 萬輛）需求的頁面。客戶被要求填寫一份調查表，表明他們在汽車設計方面的偏好。他們可以對以下五個方面進行排序：風格、舒適度、性能、價格和安全性。然後，他們被要求描述他們在汽車中最討厭的東西，並提出新功能的想法。接下來，該軟件允許客戶自己設計汽車。他們可以從各種車身風格、輪胎設計以及汽車前後部的風格中進行選擇。他們還可以檢查不同類型的頭燈、細節和功能。這樣，用戶可以嘗試不同的設計，並立即在屏幕上看到結果。該軟件捕捉了最終結果；此外，它還追踪了客戶在評估和選擇選項過程中的順序。這些信息告訴設計師客戶在評估功能、風格和特徵以達到特定設計方案

<br>

Fiat received more than 3,000 surveys in a three-month period, each comprising about ten pages of detailed information. The ideas suggested ranged from clever (an umbrella holder inside the car) to significant (a single bench front seat). Fiat used the information to inform a variety of styling and concept decisions for the next-generation Punto. And the total cost of the exercise was only $35,000, about the cost of running a few focus groups. Moreover, Fiat executives claimed that the surveys provided them with precisely the data they needed. The profile of the survey’s participants—trend-setting individuals with high incomes, who are 31 to 40 years old and frequent car buyers—was the target segment most useful to Fiat.

> 描述了 Fiat 在三個月內收到了超過 3,000 份調查，每份調查包含大約十頁的詳細信息。提出的想法從巧妙（汽車內的雨傘架）到重要（單椅子前排座椅）。Fiat 利用這些信息為下一代 Punto 的各種風格和概念決策提供了參考。而且，整個過程的成本僅為 35,000 美元，相當於舉辦幾個焦點小組的成本。此外，Fiat 高管表示，這些調查為他們提供了他們所需的精確數據。調查參與者的概況 - 高收入、年齡在 31 到 40 歲之間的潮流引領者和經常購買新車的人 - 是對 Fiat 最有用的目標客群。

<br>

General Motors’ Electro-Motive division has adopted a similar philosophy in its new virtual-product-development process. That process allows engineers to give customers digital tours of next-generation locomotives even as their development proceeds. Although the GM system is still evolving, the aim is to move to an all-digital environment in which the product moves electronically through concept design, analysis, prototyping, and manufacture, and along the way makes several stops on the customer’s desktop for feedback.

> 通用汽車的 Electro-Motive 部門在其新的虛擬產品開發過程中採用了類似的理念。該過程允許工程師在開發過程中向客戶展示下一代機車的數字化導覽。儘管 GM 系統仍在不斷演變，但目標是轉向全數字化環境，使產品在概念設計、分析、原型製作和製造過程中以電子方式移動，並在此過程中多次在客戶的桌面上獲得反饋。

## Testing Technical Solutions.

Sensing customer and market needs as a project progresses is one element of a flexible development process. If companies are going to allow a product’s design to evolve well into the design implementation phase, however, they also must adopt mechanisms that lower the cost of changes, speed their implementation, and test their impact on the overall system. Such mechanisms allow companies to evaluate and test alternative technical solutions at a rapid rate: the second element of a flexible development process.

> 靈活開發過程的一個要素是在項目進行過程中感知客戶和市場需求。然而，如果公司要允許產品設計在設計實施階段深入發展，他們還必須採用降低變更成本、加快實施速度並測試對整個系統影響的機制。這些機制使公司能夠快速評估和測試替代技術方案：靈活開發過程的第二個要素。

<br>

Early prototypes and tests of alternative technologies are critical to establishing the direction of a project. Consider NetDynamics, a company that develops sophisticated tools for linking Web servers to large databases. The single most important technical decision confronting NetDynamics during the development of its second product release was the early choice of language in its product. Either the company could develop a proprietary language, or it could use Java. At that time, in early 1996, the Java programming language had received a lot of publicity, but it was still highly unstable, relatively immature, and little understood. “We knew Java was going to be big,” recalled chief engineer Yarden Malka, “but it was still only available as a Beta 1 version. This meant that the development tools that went along with it were either terribly buggy or nonexistent. If we chose it, we knew we also had to develop many of our own tools.”

> 提到了早期原型和替代技術的測試對於確定項目方向的重要性。以 NetDynamics 為例，該公司開發了將 Web 服務器與大型數據庫連接的先進工具。在開發第二個產品版本期間，NetDynamics 面臨的最重要技術決策是在產品中早期選擇語言。公司可以開發專有語言，或者使用 Java。當時，即 1996 年初，Java 編程語言已經得到了很多關注，但它仍然非常不穩定，相對不成熟，並且知之甚少。首席工程師 Yarden Malka 回憶說：“我們知道 Java 會很大，但它仍然只是 Beta 1 版本。這意味著與之配套的開發工具要麼非常容易出錯，要麼根本不存在。如果我們選擇它，我們知道我們還必須開發很多自己的工具。”

<br>

NetDynamics’ commitment to an open platform tended to favor Java. If there was a standard—either existing or emerging—it should be used, and Java appeared to be that standard. To make the decision, however, NetDynamics’ engineers spent considerable time experimenting with various options, trying to become as comfortable as possible with the benefits and risks of each language. They began by developing simple prototypes and gradually migrated to more complex programs, attempting to gauge the advantages each would give the user. This “user-centric” approach to prototyping and experimentation was critical to the final choice and stands in stark contrast to the approach often adopted by high-tech companies in which technologies often are evaluated purely on the basis of the advantages they give the design team.

> 述了 NetDynamics 在選擇開發語言時的考慮過程。他們對開放平台的承諾使得 Java 成為有利選擇，因為它似乎是標準語言。然而，為了做出決定，NetDynamics 的工程師花了很多時間嘗試各種選項，試圖對每種語言的利弊有更多的了解。他們從開發簡單的原型開始，逐漸過渡到更複雜的程序，試圖衡量每種語言對用戶的優勢。這種以用戶為中心的原型設計和實驗方法對於最終選擇至關重要，與高科技公司常用的基於設計團隊優勢評估技術的方法形成鮮明對比。

<br>

As a project progresses, the design team must have the capacity to evaluate and test alternative design solutions quickly and cheaply. Yahoo! can easily do just that because of the way it has elected to provide its Internet service. The company meets its processing needs with many inexpensive computers instead of a few large (and expensive) servers. The small investment required for each machine allows Yahoo! to scale up its capacity smoothly to meet new demand. It also means that Yahoo! can easily run experiments to test different design options. According to Farzad Nazem, the vice president of engineering, “Our Web site setup works just like a spigot valve. If we want to test out a new product or feature on several thousand users, we promote it on the home page of only a few machines. As users access the service and we reach the required volume, we can turn off the promotion on each machine. We can also conduct comparative experiments by running multiple versions of the same service on different computers in the network, then track the results to see which version attracts more customers.”

> 描述了在項目進行過程中，設計團隊需要快速且低成本地評估和測試替代設計方案的能力。Yahoo! 之所以能夠輕鬆做到這一點，是因為它選擇了一種特殊的方式來提供互聯網服務。該公司使用許多便宜的電腦而非少量大型（且昂貴）的服務器來滿足其處理需求。每台機器所需的小投資使 Yahoo! 能夠平穩地擴大其容量以滿足新需求。這也意味著 Yahoo! 可以輕鬆地進行實驗以測試不同的設計選項。根據工程副總裁 Farzad Nazem 的說法，“我們的網站設置就像一個水龍頭閥門。如果我們想要在幾千個用戶上測試一個新產品或功能，我們只需在少數幾台機器的主頁上推廣它。當用戶訪問服務並達到所需的量時，我們可以在每台機器上關閉推廣。我們還可以通過在網絡中的不同電腦上運行相同服務的多個版本來進行比較實驗，然後追踪結果以查看哪個版本吸引了更多客戶。”

<br>

To reduce the cost of testing alternative design choices, companies outside the software industry increasingly have invested in new technologies for virtual design. By designing and testing product designs through simulation, for example, companies achieve the flexibility to respond to new information and to resolve uncertainties by quickly exploring alternatives. Computer-aided design software also has dramatically reduced the cost of design changes, while at the same time speeding up experimentation. At Boeing, for example, the all-digital development of the 777 aircraft made use of a computer-generated “human” who would climb inside the three-dimensional design on-screen to show how difficult maintenance access would be for a live mechanic. Such computer modeling allowed engineers to spot design errors—say, a navigation light that would have been difficult to service—that otherwise would have remained undiscovered until a person negotiated a physical prototype. By avoiding the time and cost associated with building physical prototypes at several stages, Boeing’s development process has acquired the flexibility to evaluate a wider range of design options than was previously possible.

> 為了降低測試替代設計選擇的成本，非軟件行業的公司越來越多地投資於虛擬設計的新技術。例如，通過模擬設計和測試產品設計，公司可以靈活地應對新信息並通過快速探索替代方案來解決不確定性。計算機輔助設計軟件也大大降低了設計變更的成本，同時加快了實驗速度。例如，在波音公司，777 型飛機的全數字化開發利用了一個計算機生成的“人”，他會在屏幕上的三維設計中爬行，以顯示對於真實機械師來說，維護訪問有多困難。這種計算機建模使工程師能夠發現設計錯誤，例如，一個難以維修的導航燈，否則在人們操作實體原型之前，這些錯誤將一直無法被發現。通過避免在幾個階段建立實體原型所需的時間和成本，波音的開發過程獲得了評估比以前可能更廣泛的設計選擇的靈活性。

## Integrating Customer Needs with Technical Solutions.

It’s no good knowing what customers want in a product under development if the development team can’t integrate that information with the available technical solutions. As a result, all the organizations we discuss have established dynamic integration mechanisms. Some of them are based on well-understood concepts, such as using dedicated teams—an approach adopted by Netscape, NetDynamics, and Microsoft. Others are less traditional. All three companies, for example, use their intranets to integrate tasks, synchronize design changes, and capture customer information as projects evolve. Thus project teams are able to keep track of the evolving relationships among tasks, schedules, and design changes in a dynamic way. Such integrating mechanisms are essential for managing a flexible process, given the many rounds of experimentation and the wide range of information generated. Without a way of capturing and integrating knowledge, the development process can quickly dissolve into chaos, with ad hoc design changes creating masses of rework because of unanticipated interactions with other components in the system.

> 強調了開發團隊需要將客戶需求與可用技術方案相結合的重要性。因此，我們討論的所有組織都建立了動態集成機制。有些基於眾所周知的概念，例如使用專門團隊，這是 Netscape、NetDynamics 和 Microsoft 採用的方法。其他方法則不太傳統。例如，這三家公司都使用內部網絡來集成任務、同步設計變更並在項目演變過程中捕獲客戶信息。因此，項目團隊能夠以動態方式跟踪任務、計劃和設計變更之間演變的關係。這種集成機制對於管理靈活過程至關重要，因為實驗的多輪次和產生的信息範圍很廣。如果沒有捕獲和集成知識的方法，開發過程很容易陷入混亂，臨時設計變更會因與系統中其他組件的未預期交互而產生大量的返工。

<br>

In the Internet world, integrating mechanisms are dictated by the nature of the product—software. Each of the projects we describe adopted sophisticated design-integration tools to hold the master version of the emerging product. As team members went to work on individual components, they checked out the code for that part of the system. Once finished, they had to run a series of tests to ensure that the component did not create problematic interactions with the rest of the system. Only then could they check in the new component. At the end of each day, when all the new components had been checked in, engineers ran the program. Any problems that occurred had to be corrected before new code could be permanently integrated.

> 在互聯網世界中，集成機制由產品（軟件）的性質決定。我們描述的每個項目都採用了先進的設計集成工具來保存正在開發的產品的主版本。當團隊成員開始研究單個組件時，他們會查看該系統部分的代碼。完成後，他們必須進行一系列測試，以確保該組件不會與系統的其他部分產生問題性的交互。只有這樣，他們才能將新組件加入。在每天結束時，當所有新組件都已加入後，工程師運行程序。在新代碼可以永久集成之前，必須解決出現的任何問題。

<br>

Similar approaches are found in projects outside the Internet world where new information systems allow companies to share knowledge more effectively. At Silicon Graphics, a leading manufacturer of workstations and servers, a new product-introduction process makes extensive use of the company’s intranet to coordinate development activities. Managers and engineers throughout the world, who respond daily to the problems of current customers, provide input during the concept-generation stage. In addition, lead users in target application segments (referred to as “lighthouse” customers) are linked directly to the development teams, allowing the teams to get fast and effective guidance on critical decisions as the project evolves. The intranet also is used to integrate design tasks on a daily basis. Project engineers work from a shared body of software that simulates the hardware design. As with the Internet projects, when team members want to make a change, they check out the relevant code, make the desired design improvements, test it for errors and unanticipated interactions, then check it back in.

> 描述了在互聯網世界之外的項目中，新的信息系統使公司能夠更有效地分享知識。在工作站和服務器的領先製造商 Silicon Graphics 中，新產品引入過程大量使用公司的內部網絡來協調開發活動。來自世界各地的管理人員和工程師每天都在解決當前客戶的問題，並在概念生成階段提供意見。此外，目標應用領域的主要用戶（被稱為“燈塔”客戶）直接與開發團隊聯繫，使團隊在項目演變過程中能夠快速有效地獲得關鍵決策的指導。內部網絡還用於每天集成設計任務。項目工程師使用共享的軟件來模擬硬件設計。與互聯網項目一樣，當團隊成員想要進行更改時，他們會查看相關代碼，進行所需的設計改進，對其進行錯誤和未預期交互的測試，然後將其重新加入。

<br>

Such approaches are not limited to high-technology products. Booz Allen & Hamilton, a management consulting firm, approaches the problem of integrating a diverse and geographically dispersed knowledge base by using its intranet. The intranet allows consulting staff quickly to locate and contact industry experts with specific skills and to identify previous studies that are relevant to current projects. In this way, the collective experience of the organization is available to all employees online. The intranet also allows the company to develop its intellectual capital. In management consulting, new-product development consists of developing new frameworks, industry best practices, performance benchmarks, and other information that can be applied across projects. By having these products on-line during development and thereafter, Booz Allen can integrate new information and experiences into its knowledge base.

> 這種方法並不僅限於高科技產品。管理顧問公司 Booz Allen & Hamilton 通過使用其內部網絡來解決整合多樣化並地理分散的知識庫的問題。內部網絡使顧問人員能夠快速找到並聯繫具有特定技能的行業專家，並確定與當前項目相關的先前研究。這樣，組織的集體經驗可以在線提供給所有員工。內部網絡還允許公司發展其智力資本。在管理顧問行業，新產品開發包括開發新框架、行業最佳實踐、績效基準和其他可應用於各個項目的信息。通過在開發過程中和之後將這些產品放在線上，Booz Allen 可以將新信息和經驗整合到其知識庫中。

<br>

Integrating within the company, however, is not always sufficient. In some cases, the ability to integrate knowledge across networks of organizations may also be important. For Internet software companies, given the novelty and complexity inherent in their products and the rapidity of their development cycles, no single organization can research, make, and market products alone. Instead, they take advantage of technical possibilities that are beyond the boundaries of any individual company; those technologies can then be integrated into their own core products. (Internet users will be familiar with Java applets and Web browser plug-ins.) Doing so, however, means that just as the technologies must be seamlessly integrated into a product, so must the organization accommodate a changing cast of players. The companies we describe have built alliances with third-party developers, engaged in joint development projects, and worked hard to foster open product architectures and modular designs. And such arrangements are not peculiar to software. Workstation manufacturers such as Sun, Hewlett-Packard, and Silicon Graphics frequently engage in joint development efforts with other hardware companies (such as Siemens, Intel, Fujitsu, Toshiba, and NEC) to leverage the performance of their systems.

> 講述了在某些情況下，僅僅在公司內部整合知識是不夠的，有時需要跨組織網絡整合知識。對於互聯網軟件公司來說，由於其產品的新穎性、複雜性以及快速的開發週期，單個組織無法獨立完成研究、製造和銷售產品。因此，他們利用超出單個公司範疇的技術可能性，將這些技術整合到自己的核心產品中（例如 Java 小程序和網絡瀏覽器插件）。然而，這意味著在技術無縫整合到產品的同時，組織也必須適應不斷變化的參與者。我們描述的這些公司與第三方開發商建立了聯盟，參與聯合開發項目，並努力促進開放的產品架構和模塊化設計。這種安排並不僅限於軟件。例如 Sun、惠普和 Silicon Graphics 等工作站製造商經常與其他硬件公司（如西門子、英特爾、富士通、東芝和日本電氣）進行聯合開發，以提高他們系統的性能。

## Putting Flexibility to the Test

In combination, the foundations of a flexible product-development process allow a company to respond to changes in markets and technologies during the development cycle. We found a striking example of how that is done in a setting that is about as far from the typical high-tech world as one can get: the America’s Cup. In 1995, a small team from New Zealand dominated the races from start to finish. Team New Zealand’s effort shows how the mechanisms we have described can be combined to dramatic effect in a flexible process.

> 作者提到了靈活的產品開發過程的基礎可以讓公司在開發周期中應對市場和技術的變化。他們舉了一個引人注目的例子，即在遠離典型高科技世界的美洲杯比賽中，1995 年一個來自新西蘭的小團隊從頭到尾主導了比賽。新西蘭隊的努力展示了我們描述的機制如何在靈活過程中結合起來產生戲劇性的效果。

<br>

## A flexible approach allows companies to respond to changes in markets and technologies during the development cycle.

Team New Zealand recruited Doug Peterson, who had been on the winning America’s Cup team in 1992, as its lead designer. It also recruited an experienced simulation team to make use of advanced design software. Although Peterson’s extensive experience drove the initial concept design, once the team’s yachts were constructed the emphasis shifted to evaluating design changes through thousands of computer-simulated design iterations. The simulations were run on a small network of workstations located a few feet from the dock. To ensure rapid feedback on the performance of design changes, the team built two boats. Each day, one of them was fitted with a design change for evaluation; then the two boats raced each other to gauge the impact of the change.

> 描述了新西蘭隊在美洲杯比賽中的成功。他們聘請了曾在 1992 年美洲杯獲勝團隊中擔任主設計師的 Doug Peterson，並組建了一個經驗豐富的模擬團隊來使用先進的設計軟件。儘管 Peterson 的豐富經驗推動了初始概念設計，但在團隊的遊艇建造完成後，重點轉向通過數千次計算機模擬設計迭代來評估設計變更。這些模擬在距碼頭幾英尺的工作站小網絡上運行。為了確保對設計變更性能的快速反饋，團隊建造了兩艘船。每天，其中一艘船會安裝一個用於評估的設計變更；然後兩艘船相互競賽，以衡量變更的影響。

<br>

Team New Zealand’s flexible process sensed “market needs” through the two-boat testing program, which generated feedback each day on how the evolving design fit the racing environment. It tested alternative designs through a simulation program that was directed by one of the world’s most experienced yacht designers. And it integrated knowledge by making the resulting information available locally. The crew, design team, and management were therefore able to make suggestions for the design, to see the impact of potential changes, and to know what to expect when those changes were tested on the water.

> 新西蘭隊的靈活過程通過兩艘船的測試計劃感知“市場需求”，每天收集有關不斷演變的設計如何適應賽事環境的反饋。它通過一個由世界上最有經驗的遊艇設計師之一主導的模擬程序測試替代設計。並通過在本地提供產生的信息來整合知識。因此，船員、設計團隊和管理層能夠為設計提出建議，了解潛在變更的影響，並知道在水上測試這些變更時可以期待什麼。

<br>

The U.S. boat that Team New Zealand faced in the final race had been designed on the latest super-computers with the support of large, well-heeled corporations. Although the U.S. team could test a massive number of experimental designs, the computers were located hundreds of miles from the dock. As a result, there were significant delays between detailing a design and getting feedback on results. Furthermore, the team had only one boat on which to test design changes; given the varying sea and wind conditions, it took far longer than its rival to verify the impact of a change.

> 描述了新西蘭隊在美洲杯比賽中面對的美國船隊。美國船隊的設計是在最新的超級計算機上完成的，並得到了大型企業的支持。儘管美國團隊可以測試大量的實驗設計，但計算機距碼頭數百英里。因此，在詳細設計和獲得反饋結果之間存在顯著的延遲。此外，該團隊只有一艘船可以測試設計變更；考慮到不同的海洋和風向條件，它比對手花更長的時間來驗證變更的影響。

<br>

Team New Zealand’s approach had better mechanisms than its U.S. rival for sensing, testing, and integrating what it had learned. Its flexible process produced a yacht of superior design, which many observers believed to be a full generation ahead of its competitors’ boats. As Paul Cayard, skipper of Team New Zealand’s opponent in the final race, remarked, “I’ve been in some uphill battles in my life. But I’ve never been in a race where I felt I had so little control over the outcome. It’s the largest discrepancy in boat speed I’ve ever seen.”

> 新西蘭隊的方法在感知、測試和整合所學到的知識方面比美國對手更具優勢。其靈活的過程產生了一艘設計卓越的遊艇，許多觀察家認為它比競爭對手的船只領先了一個世代。正如新西蘭隊在決賽中的對手 Paul Cayard 所說：“我一生中經歷過一些艱苦的戰鬥。但我從未參加過一場比賽，覺得自己對結果如此無法控制。這是我見過的船速差距最大的一次。”

<br>

## Using a flexible development process, Team New Zealand produced a superior yacht—and beat its U.S. opponent.

We have seen a similar pattern throughout many environments we have studied. Organizations that have adopted a flexible product-development process have begun to transform the very industries that forced them to adopt it. They have implemented strategies that companies clinging to traditional approaches cannot follow. Competitors without flexible development processes will almost certainly find their industries growing more and more turbulent in appearance. And in such an environment, their products and services will always seem to be one step behind those of their more flexible rivals

> 我們在研究的許多環境中都看到了類似的模式。採用靈活產品開發流程的組織已經開始改變迫使它們採用該流程的行業。他們實施了堅持傳統方法的公司無法遵循的策略。沒有靈活開發流程的競爭對手將很可能發現他們的行業變得越來越動蕩。在這樣的環境中，他們的產品和服務似乎總是落後於更靈活的競爭對手一步。

<br>
